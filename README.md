This allows you to quickly setup a React project with all you need but not necessarily all you want. The master branch should be a simple, modern setup for starting your React app.

* The goal of this is to give you a way to get going on your project quickly without having to think about how everything needs to be setup from the get go (though don't let this stop you from setting up the architecture of your app how you want).
* I plan on adding more branches for different project setup types - particularly one with Redux setup.

What this is currently setup with:

* Basic folder structure to start you off.
* Babel for transpiling down to ES5.
* React Hot Reloader + Webpack Dev Server for live reloading.
* PropTypes for... prop types.
* Jest and Enzyme for testing.
